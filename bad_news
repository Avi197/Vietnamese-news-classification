tuoitre:    title:  noname

vnexpress:  title:  some title are just broken, very short, make no sense,
                        contain half a word, or a single character, ...
                        maybe the title got cut off after the dash symbol,
                        e.g: máy bay F-22 => máy bay F (possibly bad crawling)
            tags:   which contain '- VnExpress Đời sống' are just randomly split title

dantri:     title with wrong tags
        doesn't have category in raw data file
