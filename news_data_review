Dantri is absolutely horrible
    large amount of records are unusable, which are titles with bad tags, not related tags
    some tags are just too long, contain many smaller tags but are put into one single tag

Vnexpress
    many tags are just copy of the titles, some time add an extra string ' - VnExpress Đời sống'
    some tags are just copy of the titles, but randomly split into smaller string and
        then add ' - VnExpress Đời sống' to the last smaller string, and
        those smaller string become tags for the title
    some title are just broken, contain half a word, or a single character, ...

Vnn
    contain some english news
    some titles have bad, non related marking tags, e.g: vnn, vietnamnet doc bao, ...
    one/ a few(?) record(s) have tag which is just a url

Tuoitre
    lots of titles with no tags
    some titles are just 'Noname'
